# Weather Cal Widget
Scriptable iOS home screen widget based on [Weather Cal](https://github.com/mzeryck/Weather-Cal) that displays weather and calendar events. Uses date, calendar, battery, and greeting elements. I have also utilized the "custom" object in the Weather Cal container script to add a dynamic background for sunrise and sunset.

## Items
In addition to the widget items in the Weather Cal script, the custom object here adds a dynamic background that changes at sunrise and sunset; "batterybright" item for displaying battery level and screen brightness device parameters;
